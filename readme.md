# Android To-Do List

A To-Do List Android application. The user has a list view of tasks, a new task can be created, tasks can be edited, deleted and modified. They are divided to four categories. Tasks can also be marked as completed, in which case the task colour is changed from red to green.

##### MVP
You are required to write an Android app which will allow the user to maintain a to-do list. The user should be able to enter tasks and display them in a list. The list should only show the bare details of each task. Selecting a task from the list should bring up another screen which shows full details of the task.

Users should also be able to mark tasks as completed.
